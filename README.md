# Introduction

The Sustainable Progress and Equality Collective (SPEC) is an open learning organization that helps individuals and communities become catalysts for positive change. SPEC's mission is to empower people to become globally-minded change agents by helping them learn the essential skills required to build sustainable careers and make a positive impact in their communities.&#x20;

We aim to uplift people from underrepresented backgrounds and communities by providing equitable opportunities through research, mentorship, training, work experience, service-learning, and events promoting professional growth, environmental sustainability, and social justice.

## Core Values

SPEC's founders established the collective based on the core values of **sustainability, progress,** and **equality**. These values provide a recipe for building organizations that are radically transparent, sustainable, and equitable. The world is constantly changing and SPEC will continuously evolve to adapt, incorporating the voices and collective knowledge of its members.

## Our Team

SPEC is run by a small and dedicated team of contributors and volunteers. We come from different social identities, backgrounds, and perspectives. SPEC's co-founders and steering committee work entirely on a volunteer basis, have no financial stake in the collective and do not receive compensation in any form. See our [team page](about-us/organization/team.md) to learn more.

## Our Collective

SPEC is organized as an open collective, a collaborative group that has a shared mission, which raises and spends funds transparently to achieve goals. SPEC is fiscally sponsored by the [Hack Club Bank 501(c)(3) ](https://hackclub.com/fiscal-sponsorship/)which allows it to operate without legally incorporating, and accept tax deductible donations, and pay contributors.
