# Contributor Levels

The guide provides detailed definitions for each contributor level. A contributor must satisfy the criteria specified here to qualify for a particular level. Please note that contributor levels are not reflected in a contributor's official title. For example, a contributor at the **L3 Producer** level, may have the title of **Project Manager** or **Senior Engineer**. Below are some definitions of key terms that will help in understanding this guide.

## Key Definitions

#### Supervisor

#### Individual Contributor

An individual contributor (IC) is a professional without management responsibilities who contributes to an organization independently to help support its goals and mission. While ICs must report to someone within the organization, an IC is not responsible for managing anyone except for themselves. An IC may manage of a process or project that they complete as part of a team or individually, but are not responsible for managing people. \[2]

**Expert**

#### **Leader**

A leader is responsible for getting people to understand and believe in their vision and to work with their team to achieve its goals.

## Factors That Determine Contributor Levels

**Organizational Scope and Impact**

The degree to which a contributor's actions affect the collective as a whole. This factor includes the level of responsibility a contributor performs, including the degree to which the work can create either positive or negative consequences for the collective. The effect of a contributor's actions on the collective through the nature of the work.\[4]

**Influence and Leadership**

The level of supervision, management, or direction provided as part of the contributor's responsibility.\[4]

**Knowledge**

The level and application of knowledge needed to perform the position. This factor describes the degree of expertise a contributor has in a field, discipline, or problem domain. \[4]

**Problem Solving**

The identification and application of approaches to resolving problems and making decisions. This factor is concerned a contributor's critical thinking / logical reasoning skills, as well as their interpersonal and intercultural competencies. \[4]

**Independence of Action**

The latitude the contributor has to make decisions as demonstrated by the level of review and instructions provided. \[4]

**Education and Experience**

The level of education and experience necessary to effectively contribute. Education is gained by studying and training either through a formalized educational program or self-directed learning. Experience is gained while working in a job. \[4]

## Career Tracks

SPEC has two primary career tracks, the Individual Contributor (IC) Track and the Management Track. The IC Track is for contributors who want to work for the organization independently to help support its goals and mission, but not have to manage people directly. The Management Track is for contributors who are interested directly overseeing people, processes, and projects.

## Level Descriptions

Please note that the title corresponding to the M2 level is **"Lead".** We also use the term **Leader**, to describe the primary role of an L3 contributor. Leadership is skill that is important to both ICs and managers. There is overlap between the responsibilities of leaders and managers, which can result in confusion. For clarity, when we are referring to an individual at the M2 level, for example, **Operations Lead** or **Research Lead**, we understand the term Lead as a modifier and indicator of rank. The term **Leader **should be understood as the general concept of a contributor who has leadership responsibilities.

## 🚧 Mixed Track 🚧

We recognize that many people's skills and knowledge don't always fit neatly into the IC and management tracks. For this reason the contributor levels includes the Mixed Track. Each level here combines roles and responsibilities from both tracks. A contributor on the mixed track may lean more towards IC or management, but performs duties in both areas.
