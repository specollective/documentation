# Journal of Engaged Research - Equity

The Journal of Engaged Research (JoER) is the official publication of SPEC. JoER was created to take an activist approach to address the many challenges brought about by the twin crises of the COVID-19 pandemic and the current period of social unrest. It creates a space for diverse individuals who may not have access to traditional academic publishing channels

The goal of this issue is to bring light to current matters of equities and inequities from unique perspectives. We are seeking submissions that express diverse viewpoints on the culture of social equity. We welcome both traditional pieces:

1. Academic Articles
2. Research Papers
3. Op-eds

and non-traditional media pieces including but not limited to:

1. Infographics
2. Audio & Video
3. Images
4. Creative writing pieces
